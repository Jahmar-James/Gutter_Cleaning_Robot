# Documentation Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all the documentation associated with the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project. It is essential for keeping a comprehensive record of the design decisions, progress, and historical context of the project.

## Structure

- `/Capstone_Documents`: Stores all files transferred from the capstone project, including final reports and related imagery.
  - `/images`: Contains images and diagrams used or referenced in the capstone documents.
- `/design_docs`: Contains detailed design documents, specifications, and plans for the robot. These documents outline technical requirements and design justifications.
- `/progress_reports`: Includes periodic progress reports detailing the development stages, challenges encountered, and milestones achieved throughout the project timeline.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Adding New Documents**: When adding new documents, ensure they are placed in the correct subfolder. Design-related documents go into `/design_docs`, while periodic updates belong in `/progress_reports`.
2. **File Naming Convention**: Use clear and descriptive filenames, starting with the date (in YYYYMMDD format) followed by a brief description, e.g., `20240712_Project_Initiation.pdf`.
3. **Image Handling**: Store all images in the `/images` subdirectory within the appropriate parent folder. Reference these images in documents using relative paths.

## Updating Documents

When updating an existing document, mention the date of revision in the document's footer and update the table of contents if necessary. Track major revisions in the document's revision history section.

## Purpose

The documentation is critical for ensuring continuity and coherence throughout the project lifecycle. It serves as a reference point for all team members and stakeholders, providing insight into the project's evolution and current status.
