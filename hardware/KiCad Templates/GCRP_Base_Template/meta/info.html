    <h1>Gutter Cleaning Robot PCB Design</h1>
    <h2>Based on ESP32-S3 Wroom Module</h2>

    <p>
      This project template is for a gutter cleaning robot PCB featuring the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3" target="blank">ESP32-S3 Wroom Module</a>. It supports various functionalities needed for robust and efficient gutter cleaning operations.
      <br>
      Key features include:
      <ul>
        <li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity using ESP32-S3 Wroom Module</li>
        <li>SD Card interface for logging and additional storage</li>
        <li>USB 2.0 with Type C connector for MCU Programming and Debugging (UART| JTAG) with a Diode IC for protection</li>
        <li>Battery Monitor for a 3-cell LiPo battery with over and undercurrent protection (Connected via I2C)</li>
        <li>6-Axis IMU connected via SPI 2</li>
        <li>H Bridge Motor Drive for differential drive wheels control</li>
        <li>SPI Interface for camera connection</li>
        <li>Motor interface for a DC Brushless motor with an encoder</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This project adheres to standard PCB design practices and includes specific measures for ensuring reliability and durability in outdoor environmental conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schematic and layout are designed to accommodate all specified components and ensure optimal placement for operational efficiency and maintenance ease.
