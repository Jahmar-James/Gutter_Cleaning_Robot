# Hardware Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all hardware designs and related documents for the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project. It includes PCB layouts, electronic schematics, and other technical drawings essential for the physical construction of the robot.

## Structure

- `/pcb`: Stores all printed circuit board (PCB) design files. This includes layout files, Gerber files, and any associated production documents.
- `/schematics`: Contains electronic schematics that detail the wiring and connections of electronic components used in the robot.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **File Naming**: Use a clear and descriptive naming convention. Begin with the component name, followed by the version or date, and end with the appropriate file extension, e.g., `GCRP_MotorController_v1.0.sch`.
2. **Version Control**: Always maintain a version history within your design files if possible. Incremental versions should be saved with a new version number to preserve historical designs for reference.
3. **File Format**: Prefer standardized formats that are widely used and supported in the industry. For PCB files, `.kicad_pcb` and Gerber files are recommended. For schematics, `.sch` or `.pdf` formats are advisable for broader accessibility.

## Updating Designs

Update the design files as necessary when modifications are made. Keep a log of changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file within this directory, or include detailed comments in the file headers describing the changes and their purposes.

## Purpose

The hardware files are crucial for the actual construction and assembly of the robot. They serve as the blueprints that guide the manufacturing process and ensure that all components fit together correctly and function as intended. 

## Collaborative Work

Encourage teamwork by ensuring all team members have access to the latest designs and understand the status of current hardware development. Use tools like version control systems to manage changes and track progress efficiently.
