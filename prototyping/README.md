# Prototyping Directory

## Overview
This directory is dedicated to experimental and learning activities related to the hardware design of the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project. It serves as a sandbox for testing new ideas, learning PCB design techniques, and validating concepts before they are integrated into the main project hardware.

## Structure

- `/pcb_experiments`: Contains files for PCB designs that are in the experimental stage. These are not final designs but are crucial for testing and learning.
- `/test_circuits`: Stores designs and documentation for various test circuits used to understand and experiment with different hardware configurations.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Experimental Nature**: Recognize that files in this directory are not for production. They are primarily for learning and testing new ideas.
2. **Documentation**: Document all experiments thoroughly. Each design should have a corresponding document explaining the purpose of the experiment, expected results, and actual outcomes.
3. **Clean Up**: Regularly review and clean up old or obsolete files to keep the directory manageable and focused on current experiments.

## Updating and Versioning

While strict version control may not be as critical here as in production directories, maintain a basic version history for experiments to track progress and iterations. Use simple version numbers or dates, e.g., `Sensor_Test_v1.0`, `Sensor_Test_v1.1`.

## Purpose

The prototyping area is essential for:
- Testing hypotheses and validating design concepts.
- Learning and improving PCB design skills.
- Quickly iterating on design ideas without the overhead of formal version control used in production environments.
