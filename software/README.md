# Software Directory

## Overview
This directory encompasses all the software development activities for the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project, including firmware for hardware interfaces and control algorithms that enable the robot's autonomous operations.

## Structure

- `/firmware`: Contains the microcontroller firmware that directly interacts with the robot's hardware components, such as sensors and motors.
- `/control_algo`: Houses the algorithms that control the robotâ€™s behavior and decision-making processes, focusing on autonomy and efficiency.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for readability and maintainability. Use comments generously to explain critical sections of the code.
2. **Commit Practices**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Ensure each commit represents a logical change or addition to the project.
3. **Testing**: Each major function or module should have associated tests, which are maintained in the `tests/software_tests` directory. Aim for high test coverage to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Updating and Versioning

- Keep software components up-to-date with the latest changes in hardware and design specifications.
- Use semantic versioning for releases, tagging significant updates, and deploying changes to ensure compatibility and traceability.

## Purpose

The software developed in this directory enables:
- Interaction between the robot's hardware and user commands.
- Autonomous decision-making based on environmental data and predefined objectives.
- Simulation and testing of robot behaviors under various scenarios.

## Collaboration and Documentation

- Encourage peer reviews for all major changes to ensure quality and consistency.
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for each module, detailing its function, interfaces, and interaction with other system components.
