# Tests Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all testing scripts and resources for both hardware and software components of the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project. It includes unit tests, integration tests, and hardware validation tests to ensure all components function correctly both individually and when integrated into the complete system.

## Structure

- `/hardware_tests`: Contains tests specifically designed to verify the functionality and reliability of the hardware components. This includes tests for individual PCBs, sensors, and mechanical parts.
- `/software_tests`: Houses tests for the software components, including unit tests for individual modules and integration tests that ensure modules work together as expected.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Test Development**: Develop tests concurrently with hardware and software development to ensure continuous integration and validation throughout the project lifecycle.
2. **Test Naming Convention**: Use descriptive and consistent naming for test files. Names should reflect the component or functionality being tested, e.g., `motor_controller_unit_test.py` or `navigation_integration_test.py`.
3. **Automated Testing**: Wherever possible, implement automated tests that can be run regularly. This helps in identifying regressions and ensuring stability over time.
4. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and methodology of each test within the test script itself and maintain an overview of test coverage in this README file.

## Updating and Versioning

- Regularly review and update tests to cover new features or changes in the project components. 
- Maintain a version log for significant changes in testing methodologies or when new types of tests are introduced.

## Purpose

The tests in this directory are vital for:
- Ensuring that each component meets its design specifications.
- Validating the interaction between different system components.
- Maintaining high reliability and preventing regressions during ongoing development.

## Collaboration and Reporting

- Encourage contributions to test development from all team members.
- Use test results as a key metric for project progress in team meetings and reports.
- Integrate test runs with your version control system to track test success over time.
