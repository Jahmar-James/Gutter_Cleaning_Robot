# Tools Directory

## Overview
This directory contains utility scripts and tools that assist in building, testing, and maintaining the Gutter Cleaning Robot Project. These tools are not part of the robot's operational software but are crucial for development processes such as building, deploying, and monitoring.

## Structure

- `/build_tools`: Contains scripts and configurations used for compiling software, assembling firmware, or any other build-related tasks.
- `/deployment_tools`: Scripts and utilities for deploying software updates to hardware components or simulation environments.
- `/monitoring_tools`: Utilities for monitoring system performance, logging, and debugging during development and testing phases.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Adding New Tools**: When adding new tools, ensure they are documented and placed in the appropriate subfolder. Provide usage instructions and dependencies in a `README` file within the tool's directory.
2. **Maintenance**: Regularly update tools to adapt to changes in the project's hardware or software architecture. Remove or archive tools that are no longer in use.
3. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Encourage team members to share their scripts and tools that can benefit others. Peer reviews for tools are recommended to ensure efficiency and prevent redundancy.

## Updating and Versioning

- Maintain a changelog for significant updates to any tools to track changes and functionalities added over time.
- Use semantic versioning for tools that are extensively used or form a critical part of the development pipeline.

## Purpose

The tools in this directory serve to:
- Enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks.
- Ensure consistency in builds and deployments across different environments.
- Aid in debugging and monitoring to quickly identify and resolve issues during development.

## Collaboration and Documentation

- Document how each tool fits into the overall project workflow.
- Ensure that all tools have clear, concise instructions for their intended use and setup requirements.
- Foster a culture of knowledge sharing by organizing regular walkthroughs or demos of tools developed by team members.
